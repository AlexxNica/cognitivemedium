      (<strong>Rough working
      notes, <a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, April

      Let me show you
      a <a href="https://acko.net/files/gltalks/toolsforthought/#28">wonderful
      visualization</a> of the Fourier transform, done
      by <a href="https://acko.net">Steven Wittens</a>.  Turn on your
      system sound, and take a moment to page through the
      visualization.

      A natural response to this visualization is to admire its beauty
      and the technical virtuosity involved (as of 2016) in
      implementing it in a web browser.  But what's interesting about
      the visualization goes well beyond beauty and technical
      virtuosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I saw Wittens present this demo, my jaw dropped.  I glanced
      across the room to my
      friend <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Chris Olah</a>, and he
      was looking similarly awed.  Talking later to Chris, we agreed
      that much of the impact of Wittens' demo was that <em>he was
      vividly showing us aspects of the Fourier transform that we'd
      both long understood, but had never before seen made explicitly
      visible</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When one begins learning about a mathematical object &ndash;
      say, the Fourier transform &ndash; one begins by reading the
      definition, seeing some examples, understanding some theorems
      about the object, and so on.  Those are all external
      representations related to the object.  After a lot of practice
      working with those external representations, one internalizes
      and becomes fluent with them.  They're no longer awkward
      external properties, but rather fluid and natural parts of your
      thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people &ndash; even those who think of themselves as
      &ldquo;good at mathematics&rdquo; never get beyond this stage.
      But if you continue to work hard with the mathematical object,
      if you solve more and more difficult problems with it, your
      understanding deepens further still.  You begin to develop a
      sense that goes even beyond extant external representations.
      The <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining">best
      description</a> I know of this comes from the mathematician
      William Thurston, who framed it as a question to himself:
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
	How big a gap is there between how you think about mathematics
	and what you say to others? Do you say what you're thinking?
	&hellip; We have complex minds evolved over many millions of
	years, with many modules always at work. A lot we don't
	habitually verbalize, and some of it is very challenging to
	verbalize or to communicate in any medium. Whether for this or
	other reasons, I'm under the impression that mathematicians
	often have unspoken thought processes guiding their work which
	may be difficult to explain, or they feel too inhibited to
	try.  One prototypical situation is this: there's a
	mathematical object that's obviously (to you) invariant under
	a certain transformation. For instant, a linear map might
	conserve volume for an &lsquo;obvious&rsquo; reason. But you
	don't have good language to explain your reason &mdash; so
	instead of explaining, or perhaps after trying to explain and
	failing, you fall back on computation. You turn the crank and
	without undue effort, demonstrate that the object is indeed
	invariant. &hellip; Once I mentioned this phenomenon to Andy
	Gleason; he immediately responded that when he taught algebra
	courses, if he was discussing cyclic subgroups of a group, he
	had a mental image of group elements breaking into a formation
	organized into circular groups. He said that &lsquo;we&rsquo;
	never would say anything like that to the students. His words
	made a vivid picture in my head, because it fit with how I
	thought about groups. I was reminded of my long struggle as a
	student, trying to attach meaning to &lsquo;group&rsquo;,
	rather than just a collection of symbols, words, definitions,
	theorems and proofs that I read in a textbook.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	In other words, when you undersand mathematics deeply, you
	begin to develop internal representations that are not well
	captured or easy to explain using existing external
	representations, but which nonetheless provide powerful ways
	of thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
	What makes Wittens' demo amazing is that it captured something
	of my <em>internal</em> representation of the Fourier
	transform, and made it externally visible.  It was invisible
	understanding made visible.
      </p>

      <p>
	This is not to say that I previously thought of the Fourier
	Transform in the way Wittens shows.  I did not.  Nonetheless,
	there was still a shock of recognition, a sense that Wittens'
	representation captured aspects of the Fourier transform that
	I felt, but which were not present in conventional
	representations.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, this visualization is intended as a demo.  It's not
	a working representation; it doesn't have a fully developed
	interface which one can use to work with and reason about the
	Fourier tranform.  Still, it's tempting to muse: might it be
	possible to build out an interface based on this
	representation?  Might such an interface reify important facts
	about the Fourier transform, facts which are not obvious in
	traditional representations?
      </p>

      <p>
	I'm not sure how that would work*<span class="marginnote">*
	The ideas that follow in this paragraph arose in conversation
	with Chris Olah.</span>.  One nice property of the Fourier
	transform is that the Fourier transform of a convolution of
	functions is the product of the Fourier transforms of the
	individual functions.  (This has many nice consequences,
	including making it almost trivial to prove the central limit
	theorem.)  Might this beautiful theorem have an insight-giving
	representation in this approach?  Might it, in consequence,
	then be possible to more deeply understand results like the
	central limit theorem?
      </p>

      <p>
	Marshall McLuhan wrote &ldquo;we shape our tools and
	afterwards our tools shape us&rdquo;.  When we invent powerful
	new external representations of concepts like the Fourier
	transform, that opens up a path to deeper understanding, and
	thereafter to the invention of still more powerful
	representations, in a kind of virtuous circle.
      </p>

      <p>
	So what, if any, conclusion can we draw from this?  I think
	it's something like this.  Pick any phenomenon in the world.
	Ask if existing representations reveal the deepest existing
	understanding of that phenomenon.  Not just your own
	understanding, but the understanding held by the world's most
	thoughtful experts.  If not, there's an opportunity.  How can
	we develop more powerful representations that let us see and
	act more deeply?
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>The notion of mathematical beauty:</strong>
	Mathematicians often talk of finding beauty in mathematics;
	equally often, non-mathematicians are bewildered by this.
	They look at a page of mathematics and see what appears to be
	a bunch of largely disconnected and incomprehensible
	scribbles.  The page itself may not be much more directly
	meaningful to a mathematician.  But they can use it as a
	bridge to connect them to their deeper internal
	representations.  And that's the level at which they find
	beauty: in sudden, unexpected connections, revealing
	surprising order.
      </p>

      <p>
	The non-mathematician's experience of mathematics may thus be
	compared to the experience of a severely short-sighted person
	visiting an art museum.  It is difficult to appreciate a
	Rembrandt when all you see is a blur.  You are not seeing
	Rembrandt; indeed, you have no direct access to what Rembrandt
	was doing at all.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong>Connection to Plato's caves:</strong> One might wonder
	if there's any connection to Platonic forms, and questions
	like whether mathematics is invented or discovered.  I don't
	have a strong opinion.  I will say that, to the extent one
	believes Plato's story, the purpose of building external
	representations is to better reveal the true underlying forms.
	And so this is perhaps a useful framing.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<strong>Tacit knowledge:</strong> There's a connection here to
	the concept
	of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">tacit
	knowledge</a> developed by Michael Polanyi.  One might suppose
	that I am proposing that we can use interfaces to make
	explicit what was previously tacit knowledge.  I don't
	entirely disagree with this, but I don't entirely agree with
	it, either.  The issue is that I'm not sure all of what
	Polanyi called tacit knowledge is necessarily reifiable in an
	interface. Conversely, I'm not sure we only want to reify
	tacit knowledge in an interface.  There's all sorts of
	emotional content and affordances that we want to reify as
	well (at a minimum).  So I think it would be a mistaken
	oversimplification to think merely of reifying tacit
	knowledge.
      </p>
