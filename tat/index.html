      <p>
	Have you ever felt awe and delight upon first experiencing a
	computer interface?  An interface that surprised you with its
	strangeness, with a sense of entering an alien world?
      </p>

      <p>
	Some people experience this when they play imaginative video
	games, such as <em>Monument Valley</em>, <em>Braid</em>,
	or <em>Portal</em>.  For some people, it occurs when they
	first understand how a spreadsheet program can be used to
	model a company, an industry, or even an entire country.  And
	for some people, it occurs when they first use a programming
	language based on particularly powerful ideas, such as Haskell
	or Lisp.
      </p>

      <p>
        My own first experience of this awe and delight was when I
        used the program <em>MacPaint</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
	I was 11 years old.  Up to that point, my experience of
        computers was with command line interfaces, such as the Apple
        II, IBM PC, and Commodore 64:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/C64.gif" width="500"/></center>
      
      <p>
	To do graphical work was complicated.  On my Commodore 64, I
	would sometimes make games, using graph paper to sketch out
	the pixels in my game characters, before translating them into
	a sequence of numeric values for input into the computer.  It
	was detailed, painstaking work.
      </p>

      <p>
	One day, my parents took me to an Apple dealership.  There, we
	saw a computer called a Macintosh, running a program
	called <em>MacPaint</em>.  Using a new-to-me pointing device
	called a mouse, I could sketch much more directly on a virtual
	canvas.  I remember feeling awe when I clicked on a region,
	and <em>MacPaint</em> filled the region in.  It knew where the
	borders were!  <em>MacPaint</em> also provided FatBits, a way
	to magnify the drawing, so it could be edited pixel by
	pixel. Most magical of all: if I made a mistake, I could undo
	the mistake with a click of the mouse button, returning the
	canvas to its previous state.
      </p>

      <p>
	<em>MacPaint</em> gave me a more direct connection to my
	drawing, similar to using pencils or paints.  But it also
	provided new tools making it easy to do things that were
	formerly difficult or impossible.  Today, such tools are
	familiar, and perhaps seem banal.  But for me they were an
	epiphany, transforming what it meant to draw.
      </p>

      <p>
	Of course, most people never had the particular transformative
	experience I had with <em>MacPaint</em>.  But I believe many
	people have been awed and delighted by <em>some</em>
	interface.
      </p>

      <p>
	In extreme cases, to use such an interface is to enter a new
	world, containing objects and actions unlike any you've
	previously seen.  At first these elements seem strange.  But
	as they become familiar, you internalize the elements of this
	world.  Eventually, you become fluent, discovering powerful
	and surprising idioms, emergent patterns hidden within the
	interface.  You begin to think <em>with</em> the interface,
	learning patterns of thought that would formerly have seemed
	strange, but which become second nature.  The interface begins
	to disappear, becoming part of your consciousness.  You have
	been, in some measure, transformed.
      </p>

      <h2>What makes an interface transformational?</h2>
      
      <p>
	Most interfaces are not so striking.  But the existence of
	such extreme examples poses a question: what qualities make an
	interface transformational?
      </p>
      
      <P>
	To answer that question, it helps to consider another
	transformational technology, namely, language.  Children
	acquire language in just a few years.  It's remarkable to
	watch a child hear an unfamiliar word, then later speak that
	word aloud, and gradually come to use the word in more complex
	ways.  Familiarity makes us take the process for granted, but
	it's marvellous that they can internalize an external
	phenomenon, and use it as a vehicle for their own thought.
      </p>

      <p>
	Language is an example of a <em>cognitive technology</em>: an
	external artifact, designed by humans, which can be
	internalized, and used as a substrate for cognition.  That
	technology is made up of many individual pieces &ndash; words
	and phrases, in the case of language &ndash; which become
	basic <em>elements of cognition</em>.  These elements of
	cognition are things we can think with.
      </p>

      <p>
	Language isn't the only cognitive technology we internalize.
      </p>

      <p>
	Consider visual thinking.  If, like me, you sometimes think
	visually, it's tempting to suppose your mind's eye is a raster
	display, capable of conceiving any image.  But while tempting,
	this is wrong.  In fact, our visual thinking is done using
	visual cognitive technologies we've previously internalized.
      </p>

      <p>
	For instance, one of the world's best-known art
	teachers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Edwards">Betty
	Edwards</a>, explains that the visual thinking of most
	non-artist adults is limited to what she refers to as a simple
	&ldquo;symbol system&rdquo;, and that this constrains both
	what they see and what they can visually conceive:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
	<em>[A]dult students beginning in art generally do not really
	  see what is in front of their eyes &mdash; that is, they do
	  not perceive in the way required for drawing.  They take
	  note of what's there, and quickly translate the perception
	  into words and symbols mainly based on the symbol system
	  developed throughout childhood and on what they know about
	  the perceived object.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	It requires extraordinary imagination to conceive new forms of
	visual meaning &ndash; i.e., new visual cognitive
	technologies.  Many of our best-known artists and visual
	explorers are famous in part because they discovered such
	forms.  When exposed to that work, other people can
	internalize those new cognitive technologies, and so expand
	the range of their own visual thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, cubist artists such as Picasso developed the
	technique of using multiple points of view in a single
	painting.  Once you've learnt to see cubist art, it can give
	you a richer sense of the structure of what's being shown:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/Picasso1910.jpg"></center>

      <p>
	Another example is the work
	of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Eugene_Edgerton">Doc
	Edgerton</a>, a pioneer of high-speed photography, whose
	photographs revealed previusly unsuspected structure in the
	world.  If you study such photographs, you begin to build new
	mental models of everyday phenomena, enlarging your range of
	visual thought:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/Edgerton1964.jpg"></center>

      <p>
	Another class of examples comes from the many cartographers
	who've developed ways to visually depict geography. Consider,
	for example, the 1933 map of the London Underground, developed
	by Harry Beck.  In the early 1930s, Beck noticed that the
	official map of the Underground was growing too complex for
	readers to understand.  He simplified the map by abandoning
	exact geographic fidelity, as was commonly used on most maps
	up to that point.  He concentratd instead on showing the
	topological structure of the network of stations, i.e., what
	connects to what:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/Underground1933_web.jpg" width="600"/></center>

      <p>
	Images such as these are not natural or obvious.  No-one would
	ever have these visual thoughts without the cognitive
	technologies developed by Picasso, Edgerton, Beck, and many
	other pioneers.  Of course, only a small fraction of people
	really internalize these ways of visual thinking.  But in
	principle, once the technologies have been invented, most of
	us can learn to think in these new ways.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let's come back to computer interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
	In a similar way to language, maps <em>etc</em>, a computer
	interface can be a cognitive technology.  To master an
	interface requires internalizing the objects and operations in
	the interface; they become elements of cognition.  A
	sufficiently imaginative interface designer can invent
	entirely new elements of cognition:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/possible_vs_extant_elements.png"></center>
      
      <p>
	I believe this is what made <em>MacPaint</em> so exciting to
	11 year-old me: it expanded the range of thoughts I could
	think.  As a practical matter, this expressed itself as an
	expansion in the range of visual images I could create.  In
	general, what makes an interface transformational is when it
	introduces new elements of cognition that enable new modes of
	thought.  More concretely, such an interface makes it easy to
	have insights or make discoveries that were formerly difficult
	or impossible.  At the highest level, it will enable
	discoveries (or other forms of creativity) that go beyond all
	previous human achievement.  Alan Kay has
	asked*:<span class="marginnote">* Alan
	Kay, <a href="assets/Kay_What_is_a_Dynabook.pdf">What is a
	Dynabook?</a> (2013).</span> &ldquo;what is the carrying
	capacity for ideas of the computer?&rdquo; Similarly, we may
	ask: what is the carrying capacity for discovery of the
	computer?
      </p>
      
      <h2>How can we invent new elements of cognition?</h2>
	
      <p>
	Of course, most interfaces are re-combinations of standard
	elements, and don't introduce any new elements of cognition.
	Are there heuristics we can use to invent new elements of
	cognition?
      </p>

      <p>
	As a way of getting insight into that question, I will begin
	by showing a prototype interface.  It's a prototype for
	exploring one-dimensional motion, that is, the motion of a
	particle on a line.  To avoid disappointment, let me say that
	this prototype certainly isn't transformative in the same way
	as <em>MacPaint</em>!  It's rough, a first sketch of an idea.
	But, as we'll discuss below, it illustrates two useful
	heuristics which can help us invent new elements of cognition.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Note that this prototype is aimed at people who've taken an
	introductory physics class.  That means familiarity with ideas
	such as the potential and kinetic energy of a particle.  If
	you've less background in physics, I hope the gist is
	accessible.  If you've more background, please put yourself
	back in the mindframe of a relative beginner.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note also that the prototype begins with some background
	explanation, before showing an actual interface.  Here it
	is*<span class="marginnote">* An archived copy of this video

      <h3>Heuristic 1: Reify hidden representations in the
      interface</h3>
      
      <p>
	To understand the motivation behind this prototype, consider
	the
	following <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining">question</a>
	from the mathematician William Thurston:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>How big a gap is there between how you think about
	  mathematics and what you say to others?  Do you say what
	  you're thinking?&hellip;
	  
	  <br><br>I'm under the impression that mathematicians often have
	  unspoken thought processes guiding their work which may be
	  difficult to explain, or they feel too inhibited to try&hellip;
	  
	  <br><br>Once I mentioned this phenomenon to Andy Gleason; he
	  immediately responded that when he taught algebra courses, if
	  he was discussing cyclic subgroups of a group, he had a mental
	  image of group elements breaking into a formation organized
	  into circular groups.
	  
	  <br><br>He said that 'we' never would say anything like that
	  to the students.
	  
	  <br><br>His words made a vivid picture in my head, because it
	  fit with how I thought about groups.  I was reminded of my long
	  struggle as a student, trying to attach <strong>meaning</strong>
	  to 'group', rather than just a collection of symbols, words,
	  definitions, theorems and proofs that I read in a textbook.
	</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	We can paraphrase Thurston as saying that mathematicians often
	don't think about mathematical objects using the conventional
	representations found in books.  Rather, they rely heavily on
	what we might call <em>hidden</em> representations, such as
	the mental imagery Thurston describes, of groups breaking into
	formations of circular groups.  Such hidden representations
	help them reason more easily than the conventional
	representations, and occasionally provide them with what may
	seem to others like magical levels of insight.
      </p>

      <p>
	This use of hidden representations occurs in many fields.  For
	example, electrical engineer Gerald Sussman
	has <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-To-Compute">observed</a>
	the following about understanding electric circuits:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	I was teaching my first classes in electrical engineering at
	MIT, in circuit theory&hellip; and I observed that what we
	taught the students wasn't at all what the students were
	actually expected to learn.  That is, what an expert person
	did when presented with a circuit&hellip; was quite different
	from what we tell [the students] to write down &ndash; the
	node equations&hellip; and then you're supposed to grind these
	equations together somehow and solve them, to find out what's
	going on. Well, you know, that's not what a really good
	engineer does.  What a good engineer does is [&hellip;]
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	At this point, Sussman goes into a long, informal analysis.
	It's fascinating, and unlike anything I've ever heard in an
	electric circuits class.  I won't quote Sussman's analysis
	here &ndash; it really needs his voice and body language
	&ndash; but you can see it just after the 26 minute mark
	in <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-To-Compute">his
	talk</a>. Sussman concludes:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	And every real engineer does that.  And that was not the sort
	of thing which we were teaching the students.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	The energy surface prototype is based on the kind of hidden
	representation described by Thurston and Sussman.  In
	particular, it's based on the way I often visualize
	one-dimensional motion, in my work as a theoretical physicist.
	The visuals are not original to me: when I've shown the
	prototype to other physicists, several have told me &ldquo;Oh,
	I think about one-dimensional motion like this&rdquo;. But
	while this way of understanding may be common among
	physicists, they rarely talk about it.  For instance, it's not
	the kind of thing one would use in teaching a class on
	one-dimensional motion.  At most, you might make a few
	ancillary sketches along these lines for the students.
	Certainly, you would not put this way of thinking front and
	center, or expect students to answer homework or exam
	questions using energy surfaces.  Nor would you use such a
	representation in a research paper.
      </p>

      <p>
	The situation is strange.  A powerful way of thinking about
	one-dimensional motion is largely absent from our shared
	conversations.  The reason is that traditional media are
	poorly adapted to working with such representations.  This
	prototype challenges us to build an interface which explicitly
	makes energy surfaces central to how we think (and
	communicate) about one-dimensional motion.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Such an interface would go far beyond the prototype I've
	shown. It would integrate energy surfaces with the traditional
	approach to one-dimensional motion, based on algebra,
	differential equations, and Newton's laws. It would thus
	combine both traditional and novel elements of cognition, and
	result in a very different way of thinking about
	one-dimensional motion*<span class="marginnote">* Since this
	kind of visual approach has been used by other physicists, you
	may object that the energy surface and other elements are not
	truly <em>new</em> elements of cognition.  While that's
	literally true, very few people studying physics ever see this
	approach in any depth. And so, for most people, these are new
	elements of cognition.</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	One-dimensional motion is an important but specialized
	subject.  What about other subjects?  Are there other hidden
	representations used by experts, but not in general use?  What
	were Gleason and Thurston imagining when they thought about
	mathematical groups?  Can we tease those ideas out, and use
	them to inspire interface ideas?  What about Sussman's way of
	thinking about electric circuits?  Perhaps we can take some of
	the representations
	<a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking">mathematicians
	use</a> for thinking about high-dimensional geometry, and turn
	those into an interface?  What about other subjects?  I've
	used examples from physics and mathematics because that's my
	training, but I believe that for most subjects of any depth,
	experts have hidden representations that could inspire
	interfaces reifying those representations.
      </p>

      <p>
	I suspect a good source of such representations is what I
	call <em>minimal canonical examples</em>.  Experts often
	possess a stock of concrete examples that they use to reason
	in a way that generalizes.  For instance, suppose a
	mathematician is working on some problem in high-dimensional
	geometry or topology.  They may be reasoning about many
	spatial dimensions &ndash; maybe even an infinite number!
	&ndash; and yet their rough working notes are likely filled
	with diagrams of objects in 2 and 3 dimensions.  Those
	diagrams help the mathematician think, standing-in for the
	higher-dimensional objects.  For example, the mathematician
	Vitali
	Milman <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/posts/26010/revisions">likes
	to</a> think about high-dimensional convex bodies using
	diagrams showing a sort of &ldquo;spiky&rdquo; object, like
	the following:
      </p>

      <center>
	<img src="assets/Milman.png" width="300"/>
      </center>

      <p>
	This appears strange, since convex bodies are bodies that
	bulge outward everywhere, like a convex lens.  They certainly
	aren't spiky, with inward curves.  But Milman uses this
	representation to remind himself of an extremely important and
	non-inuitive fact about high-dimensional convex bodies: nearly
	all their volume is near their surface.  In 2 or 3 dimensions
	that fact is more accurately represented by a spiky body, like
	that shown above, than it is by a 2-or-3-dimensional convex
	body, and that's why Milman finds it a useful aid to thought.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Experts often possess many such minimal canonical examples,
	together with heuristics they can use to reason rapidly about
	the examples.  Those heuristics are often quick-fire rules of
	thumb, full of exceptions and special clauses, not rigorous
	proof techniques.  They let experts sketch out arguments, and
	figure out what is likely true, and what is likely false.  In
	short, they're a powerful way of exploring and obtaining
	insight.
      </p>

      <p>
	This contrasts with the approach in most computer reasoning
	systems.  For instance, much work on doing mathematics by
	computer has focused on automating symbolic computation
	(e.g., <em>Mathematica</em>), or on finding rigorous
	mathematical proofs (e.g., <em>Coq</em>). In both cases, the
	focus is on correct mathematical reasoning.  Yet in creative
	work the supply of rigorously correct proofs is merely the
	last (and often least interesting) stage of the process.  The
	majority of the creative process is instead concerned with
	rapid exploration relying more on heuristics and rules of
	thumb than on rigorous proof.  We may call this the logic of
	heuristic discovery.  Developing such a logic is essential to
	building exploratory interfaces.  I've done some preliminary
	investigations of what such a logic may look like
	in <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/emm.html">Toward an
	Exploratory Medium for Mathematics</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	If experts often develop their own representations, why do
	they sometimes not share those representations?  To answer
	that question, suppose you think hard about a subject for
	several years &ndash; say, cyclic subgroups of a group, to use
	Thurston's example.  Eventually you push up against the limits
	of existing representations.  If you're strongly motivated
	&ndash; perhaps by the desire to solve a research problem
	&ndash; you may begin inventing new representations, to
	provide insights difficult through conventional means.  You
	are effectively acting as your own interface designer.  But
	the new representations you develop may be held entirely in
	your mind, and so are not constrained by traditional static
	media forms. Or even if based on static media, they may break
	social norms about what is an &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;
	argument.  Whatever the reason, they may be difficult to
	communicate using traditional media.  And so they remain
	private, or are only discussed informally with expert
	colleagues.
      </p>

      <h3>Heuristic 2: Reify deep principles about the world in the
      interface</h3>
	
      <p>
	In the traditional approach to one-dimensional motion, the
	principle of conservation of energy is written in an algebraic
	form, as:
      </p>

      <p class="equation">
	&frac12; <em>m</em> <em>v</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>U(x)</em> = constant
      </p>

      <p>
	In an expert's hands this is a powerful basis for thinking
	about the system.  However, it has many limitations.  The
	connections to motion are left implicit, not explicit: we
	don't directly see space or velocity or the particle's
	trajectory; we don't directly see the potential or the
	energy. By contrast, the energy surface interface makes these
	things explicit and easy to manipulate; it directly reifies
	the principle of conservation of energy.  This makes it
	effortless to pose and answer questions that require much work
	in the algebraic approach.
      </p>

      <p>
	This shouldn't be confused for an argument that visualization
	is good, and algebra is bad.  There is a cargo cult mentality
	which embraces visualization for the sake of visualization.
	In fact, there is no <em>a priori</em> reason a visual
	approach is superior.  Rather, one must understand both the
	benefits and deficits of any specific approach.
      </p>

      <p>
	A good demonstration of this is the remarkable
	book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm/book.html">Structure
	and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a>, by Sussman and
	Wisdom.  The book explains the ideas of classical mechanics
	through the medium of Lisp programs.  In our terms, the book
	implements a Lisp-based interface to classical mechanics,
	complete with many new elements of cognition.  It thus
	provides new ways of thinking about classical mechanics, but
	is not a visual interface.
      </p>
	
      <p>
	Returning to conservation of energy and the energy surface
	prototype, there's a useful heuristic here: any deep principle
	is an opportunity to create powerful interface ideas.  Every
	theorem of mathematics, every significant result of science,
	is a challenge to our imagination as interface designers.  Can
	we find ways of expressing these principles in an interface?
	What new objects and new operations does a principle suggest?
	What <em>a priori</em> surprising relationship between those
	objects and operations are revealed by the principle?  Can we
	find interfaces which vividly reveal those relationships,
	preferably in a way that is unique to the phenomenon being
	studied?  By answering these questions, we can turn a
	surprising and non-intuitive principle into a source of
	intuition and novel understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
	One consequence of reifying deep principles in an interface is
	that mastering the subject begins to coincide with mastering
	the interface*<span class="marginnote">* I discuss this also
	in <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/emm/emm.html">Toward an
	Exploratory Medium for Mathematics</a> (2016).</span>.  This
	is visible already in the energy surface prototype, where
	mastering the interface requires understanding the
	relationship between the potential, the energy surface, and
	the trajectories.  Thus, mastering the interface requires
	understanding a lot of physics!
      </p>

      <p>
	Another example of this phenomenon is the
	program <em>Photoshop</em>, which builds in many deep
	principles of image manipulation.  As you master interface
	elements such as layers, the clone stamp, and brushes, you're
	well along the way to becoming an expert in image
	manipulation.  Similarly, someone who masters the interfaces
	in <em>Structure and Interpretation of Classical
	Mechanics</em> necessarily learns a lot of classical
	mechanics.  By contrast, the interface to
	<em>Microsoft Word</em> contains few deep principles about
	writing, and as a result it is possible to
	master <em>Word</em>'s interface without becoming a passable
	writer.  This isn't so much a criticism of <em>Word</em>, as
	it is a reflection of the fact that we have relatively few
	really strong and precise ideas about how to write well.

      <h3>An interface for projectile motion</h3>
      
      <p>
	Let me show another prototype interface illustrating the two
	heuristics I've identified.  This second prototype is intended
	to help us explore two-dimensional projectile motion.
	Although that may sound similar to the energy surface
	prototype &ndash; it's just classical mechanics in one more
	spatial dimension!  &ndash; it's actually a very different
	subject, and the interface is, accordingly, very different.
	It's also more ambitious than the prototype for
	one-dimensional motion, in that I'll use it to attack a
	problem I didn't know how to solve before building the
	interface.  As before, it's a rough sketch, and presumes
	comfort with basic mechanics and mathematics.  Let's take a
	look*<span class="marginnote">* An archived copy of this video

	This prototype uses both our heuristics.  The fan of multiple
	trajectories and the wavefront of projectile positions are
	representations familiar to some experts, but are unknown to
	most students of physics.  And those representations, in turn,
	reify a fundamental theorem of mechanics, expressing the range
	of trajectories that can pass through two specified points.
      </p>

      <p>
	The projectile prototype is very different from the energy
	surface prototype.  This is perhaps surprising, because in the
	traditional algebraic approach, one- and two-dimensional
	motion appear similar.  But that similarity is superficial and
	misleading.  In fact, very different ideas help to understand
	motion in the two cases.  For instance, the trajectory fan
	helps in two dimensions, but is less useful in one dimension,
	where the particle merely moves back and forward on the line.
	As another example, in one dimension the trajectories are
	completely determined by the principle of conservation of
	energy.  In two dimensions, that's no longer true, and so the
	principle is less useful.  Differences such as these are
	obscured in the traditional algebraic approach, and experts
	take years to internalize them.  But in interfaces reifying
	the deepest ideas about a system, such differences are
	immediately evident.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
	In the 1960s and 1970s, Douglas Engelbart, J. C. R. Licklider,
	Alan Kay, and others developed a vision of computers as
	devices for augmenting and extending human beings.  This
	vision strongly influenced later researchers and
	entrepreneurs, including people such as Steve Jobs, and has
	now entered mainstream media accounts.
      </p>

      <p>
	A common informal model of augmentation is what we may call
	the <em>cognitive outsourcing</em> model: we specify a
	problem, send it to our device, which solves the problem,
	perhaps in a way we-the-user don't understand, and sends back
	a solution:
      </p>

      <center>
	<img src="assets/outsourcing_model.svg"/>
      </center>

      <p>
	So, for example, if I want to know the distance to the moon, I
	send the question to Google, which sends back an answer:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/outsourcing_question.png"/></center>

      <p>
	Or I can ask Google Maps the route from my office to Berkeley:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/outsourcing_map.png"/></center>

      <p>
	Many people implicitly or explicitly use this cognitive
	outsourcing model to think about augmentation.  It's commonly
	used in press accounts, for instance.  It is also, I believe,
	a common way for programmers to think about augmentation.
      </p>

      <p>
	In this essay, we've seen a different way of thinking about
	augmentation.  Rather than just solving problems expressed in
	terms we already understand, the goal is to change the
	thoughts we can think:
      </p>

      <center><img src="assets/possible_vs_extant_elements.png"></center>

      <p>
	One challenge in such work is that the outcomes are so
	difficult to imagine.  What new elements of cognition can we
	invent?  How will they affect the way human beings think?  We
	cannot know until they've been invented.
      </p>

      <p>
	As an analogy, compare today's attempts to go to Mars with the
	exploration of the oceans during the great age of discovery.
	These appear similar, but while going to Mars is a specific,
	concrete goal, the seafarers of the 15th through 18th
	centuries didn't know what they would find.  They set out in
	flimsy boats, with vague plans, hoping to find something worth
	the risks.  In that sense, it was even more difficult than
	today's attempts on Mars*<span class="marginnote">* This
	analogy was suggested to me
	by <a href="http://www.tophtucker.com/">Toph
	Tucker</a>.</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Something similar is going on with intelligence augmentation.
	There are many worthwhile goals in technology, with very
	specific ends in mind.  Things like artificial intelligence
	and life extension are solid, concrete goals.  By contrast,
	new elements of cognition are harder to imagine, and seem
	vague by comparison.  By definition, they're ways of thinking
	which haven't yet been invented.  There's no omniscient
	problem-solving box or life-extension pill to imagine.  We
	cannot say <em>a priori</em> what new elements of cognition
	will look like, or what they will bring.  But what we can do
	is ask good questions, and explore boldly.

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>
	<em>Broad origin:</em> This essay arose out of my attempts to
	make sense of the work of some of the great interface
	designers, including Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor,
	and others.  See, for an entr&#233;e,
	Engelbart's <a href="assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting
	Human Intellect</a>, Kay and

	Media</a>, and

	Thinking the Unthinkable</a>.

      <p>
	<em>On reifying hidden representations:</em> This was inspired
	in part by the work of Steven Wittens, especially his
	<a href="https://acko.net/tv/toolsforthought/">extraordinary
	rendition of the Fourier transform</a>.  Of course, the
	heuristic is used in much other work, but Wittens' work shows
	it in a particularly sharp and effective form.

      <p>
	<em>On reifying deep principles:</em> This was inspired in
	part by Kasper
	Peulen's <a href="http://euclidthegame.com/Tutorial/">Euclid:
	the Game</a>, which builds up an interface using ideas from
	Euclidean geometry.  Again, this heuristic is used widely, but
	Peulen's game shows it in a particularly well distilled form.
