      A book I love is “Proofs and Refutations” (Imre Lakatos).  A
      big point of that book is that people tend to think of
      definitions & categories as starting points, from which we
      derive theorems or scientific results about the world.  But
      the process really works the other way round.  Definitions and
      categories are things which emerge _after_ we’ve understood
      phenomena in the world, and as a consequence of that
      understanding.  And so while it’s worth making very tentative
      definitions, it’s a mistake to do so too prematurely, or to
      hold too strongly to them.  Those tentative definitions are,
      at best, scaffolding to help arrive at an understanding, which
      may eventually result in good definitions.

      (Lakatos's particular examples are extraordinary, if you
      haven’t read him: he explains the 150 or so years it took to
      arrive at the modern definition of polytopes, simplicial
      complexes, homology etc, all basically as a consequence of
      trying to understand Euler’s idea for a proof of his formula
      for a polyhedron: E - H + V = 2.  He also has an appendix
      where does the same thing for notions such as differentiable
      and continuous functions.)

      All of which is a way of saying that I tend to be skeptical of
      definitions & categories early on, and reluctant to commit.
      My book on open science and collective intelligence doesn’t
      define either (perhaps I carry this perversely too far, to be
      honest). Rather, my approach was to gather examples and ask
      “How can I best understand these? What unifying principles and
      governing mechanisms are there?  What differences” Having made
      some progress on those questions, I’d actually now be somewhat
      comfortable defining open science, though not yet collective
      intelligence.

      The same is true of interfaces, media, symbol systems, etc.
      We don’t yet know what an interface is.  What seems clear to
      me is that your examples - Venn diagrams, causal graphs etc -
      do provide very interesting vehicles for thought, at least in
      the hands of experts.  In fact, the particular Venn diagram I
      use in this essay is something that recurs through all my
      writing (only the labels change): I find it one of the most
      generative tools I have for thinking (and feeling) about the
      world.
