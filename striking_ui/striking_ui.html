    <h2>Striking user interfaces</h2>
	
    <p>
      <span class="marginnote">Rough and incomplete working notes,
      by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org">Michael Nielsen</a>.
      Thanks to John Workman for a conversation that made them a lot
      clearer.  The notes were used for a presentation at
      the <a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. Press
      &ldquo;n&rdquo; to advance forward through the presentation, and
      &ldquo;p&rdquo; to move back.  Note that the scrolling was
      quickly hacked together to work with my machine configuration

	  explore it</em> &ndash; John Wheeler</blockquote>
    </p>
	
    <p>
      What are the strangest and most interesting user interfaces?
      What principles underly those interfaces?
    </p>

    <p>
      Motivating hunches (which I'll come back to): we've discovered
      no more than an infinitesimal fraction of the most powerful user
      interface ideas; powerful new interface ideas help expand the
      range of thoughts we can think*<span class="marginnote">* See
     <a href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">Media for Thinking the Unthinkable</a>.</span>.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/possible_ui.png"/>

    <p>
      Natural question: what new interface ideas can we discover?  How
      can we expand the range of thoughts we can think?
    </p>

    <p>
      These are questions I'm very interested in, and puzzling over.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't have good answers.  But I thought it might be fun to
      show some striking interfaces, and talk a bit about some things
      I've learned, and interesting questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such a talk structure is a bit unusual.
    </p>

    <p>
      Often a talk starts with a well-posed puzzle or mystery, then
      develops an answer, and wraps up in a satisfying conclusion that
      partially or completely resolves the mystery.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this talk, my goal is fuzzier.  I'm merely trying to explore
      and better understand some striking user interface ideas.  The
      motivating puzzle &ndash; develop UI ideas that can expand the
      range of thoughts we can think &ndash; is so far in the
      background as to be barely visible.  So you should view this as
      exploration and play more than as problem solving with a
      satisfying conclusion.  Hopefully that'll occur in a future
      presentation!
    </p>

    <p>
      Lots of books (and other resources) on UI design.  Most take UI
      primitives as a relatively fixed set, and ask how to use them to
      build good interfaces.  But the stance here is more that of:
      where do the primitives come from?  How are they invented?  How
      might we invent new ones?</p>

    <p>We won't answer these questions.  But it's where I'm coming
      from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Invention of new UI primitives is important.  New UI primitives
      &ndash; the hyperlink, the search box, the written
      word*<span class="marginnote">* I'm not going to define UI, nor
      to draw much of a distinction between static media, and
      interactive interfaces.  I'm more interested in gathering data
      about powerful examples than in imposing <em>a priori</em>
      restrictions.</span> &ndash; are often tremendously important
      vehicles for thought.
    </p>
      
      
    <h3>Manipulating time in user interfaces: the
    game <em>Braid</em></h3>

    <p>
      <em>Braid</em> provides several models allowing you to
      manipulate time.</p>

    <p>The simplest model lets the player backtrack, a kind of
      continuous undo or version control.</p>

    <p>
      In the follow excerpt, I show the player encountering two
      unexpected obstacles.  In many games you would die.
      In <em>Braid</em> you die, but can then undo or rewind your
      actions, taking you back to an earlier game state.  Then you can
      attempt the obstacle again, but with the advantage of knowing
      what to expect.  Here's the excerpt:
    </p>

    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="assets/braid_basic.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	Your browser does not support this video format
    </video>

    <p>
      Later parts of the game gradually give us more elaborate ways of
      manipulating time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next excerpt, the player sees that they need a key to
      unlock the gate on the far right of the screen.  They must get
      the key from the creature at the bottom of the pit.  But how can
      they get out of the pit?  Let's take a look:
    </p>
    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="assets/braid_sparkly.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      Your browser does not support this video format
    </video>

    <p>
      Ahah! We learn that green sparkly things don't go backward in
      time.  They continue forward in time, while everything else
      rewinds.  This extends the previous model of time we had, in
      which everything was rewound.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this excerpt we're actually using our control of time to
      solve otherwise insoluble puzzles.  Indeed, each new model of
      time gives the game designer space to discover new puzzles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the following puzzle.  We'd like to use the clouds as
      platforms to jump across to the cannon on the far right of the
      screen.  But it's not possible because the spacing is wrong.
      However, we can use our new model of controlling time &ndash;
      green sparkly clouds always move forward in time! &ndash; to get
      the spacing between the clouds just right:
    </p>

    <video width="70%" controls>
      <source src="assets/braid_clouds.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>

    </video>

    <p>
      <em>Braid</em> continues in this way, with several more models
      of time control, and dozens of puzzles whose solution requires
      increasing virtuosity in using time control.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      User interface primitives become basic mental representations
      and operations
    </h3>

    <p>
      When you play <em>Braid</em> intensely, you start to incorporate
      the control of time as a primitive operation in your thinking.
      I found myself wanting to rewind in everyday life.  And you
      become increasingly adept at reasoning about time control.  The
      time control operations are incorporated into your mental
      lexicon.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a similar way, people experiencing
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Tetris
      effect</a> compulsively imagine rotating real-world objects, and
      fitting them into slots in the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specific games are not (usually) durable parts of people's
      lives, and this effect rapidly fades.
    </p>

    <p>
      But many user interface operations are internalized as part of
      our everyday thinking.  For instance, everyone is used to
      clicking and dragging the mouse pointer to select part of a
      document.  This seems simple and natural, but it is, of course,
      an operation that was invented (in several stages).  For
      instance, here's how Bill
      Atkinson <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=MacPaint_Evolution.txt">invented</a>
      the &ldquo;marching ants&rdquo; which were introduced in Apple's
      Mac and Lisa systems, and are still used today in many selection
      tools:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/atkinson.png"/>

    <p>
      Let's assume:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>We internalize external methods of representation we've
	seen (words, maps, graphs, mathematical
	notation, <em>etc</em>).</li>

      <li>We internalize operations we've seen (selection, following
	a link, cut-and-paste, <em>etc</em>).</li>

      <li>Those internalized representations and operations are
	incorporated into and maybe even become the basis for our
	cognition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It's common to say technology is augmenting human cognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usual examples are things like search or maps, which
      simplify problems that previously were quite difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I think there's a much more fundamental way of using
      technology to augment cognition.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We think of our minds as existing in a biological substrate.
    </p>

    <p>
      But equally important as a substrate for thought are words,
      sketches, mathematical symbols, musical notes, and so.  And
      these are technologies: they're things people have invented.  By
      inventing new representations and ways of interacting with them,
      maybe we can change the way people think.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Monument Valley
    </h3>

    <p>
      Another interesting UI is in the game <em>Monument Valley</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (It's notable, by the way, that a lot of UI innovation happens
      in games.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following, you're the white character.  You're trying to
      push the button on the left.  But you're blocked from getting
      there by a black crow.  What do you do?
    </p>

    <video width="30%" controls>
      <source src="assets/mv_gravity.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
	Your browser does not support this video format
    </video>

    <p>
      Solving this puzzle depends crucially on understanding and
      working within an unusual model of gravity.  Indeed, that
      unusual model of gravity is what makes the puzzle possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's look at another example:
    </p>
    
    <video width="30%" controls>
      <source src="assets/mv_escher.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
      Your browser does not support this video format
    </video>

    <p>
      This example relies on well-known hacks of the human perceptual
      system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reality is 3d &rarr; 2d input device (eyes) &rarr; inverted by our brain to a 3d model.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no unique way of doing that inversion.  We rely on cues
      from things like shadows etc.  Because of this non-uniqueness,
      we can fool the brain into thinking that two points are
      simultaneously: (1) at the same height; and (2) at different
      heights.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      To solve the puzzle, we must learn to reason (at least in a
      limited way) about such hacks of our perceptual system.  It's
      notable that once we're up the stairs, the player never
      &ldquo;climbs higher&rdquo;, yet ends up &ldquo;higher&rdquo; in
      space.  Figuring out how to do that is really the point of this
      puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Monument Valley</em>
      was <a href="https://unity3d.com/showcase/case-stories/monument-valley">built</a>
      using <em>Unity</em>'s 3d game engine.  I don't know how this
      worked &ndash; I don't think <em>Unity</em> is built to support
      impossible structures!  I presume they used one-off hacks /
      kludges to get the desired physics, not a genuine
      model*<span class="marginnote">* Some circumstantial evidence:
      the actions you can take in the game are extremely constrained.
      I suspect this isn't an accident, but it is a deliberate design
      choice to make the other kludges possible. </span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Could you build a game engine that wasn't 2d or 3d, as usually
      construed, but rather <em>systematically</em> incorporated these
      kinds of hacks of our perceptual system?  What data structures
      would you use to model such systems?   
    </p>

    <h2>Miegakure: gaming in 4 dimensions</h2>

    <iframe width="853" height="480"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9yW--eQaA2I" frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>
      Again, we see the same pattern: problems in 4-dimensional
      geometry become sources of game puzzles.
    </p>

    <p>
      A general pattern is that deep insights from <em>outside</em>
      computing can often be reified as interesting UI.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Many of the ideas behind modern user interfaces were invented
      by Alan Kay's group at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.  It's striking
      that
      Kay's <a href="http://www.squeakland.org/resources/books/readingList.jsp">recommended
      reading</a> is mostly books <em>outside computing</em>.  In
      published interviews, Kay has talked about how many of the ideas
      in those books inspired interface ideas.)
    </p>
      
    <h2> Why are time control, gravity change <em>etc</em>
    interesting?
    </h2>

    <p>All are, loosely speaking, changes to the laws of physics.  But
      so what?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One (relatively) consistent rule change that can be applied
      uniformly to many different contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lots of UI is only locally applicable.  We think of tools
      &ndash; &ldquo;change this font!&rdquo; &ndash; which are
      applied locally.  But in these cases we have a consistent
      globally applied rule.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Tentatively: prefer &ldquo;always on&rdquo; UI to UI tools that
      have to be manually applied.
    </p>

    <p>
      A benefit of always-on UI is that it becomes a condition in
      which we live.  The rules are simple and fixed, and we're just
      trying to understand new consequences of those rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      This seems to be enormous fun for human beings, for reasons I
      don't entirely understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's also a contrast to the approach used in much UI: largely
      static conditions, with tools to be explicitly applied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge is finding global rules which mean that simple
      choices by the user lead to interesting emergent structure.  I
      don't understand very well how to find such global rules.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Things I'd like to do</h2>

    <p>
      Look at a much wider array of examples (text, programming
      languages, standard iconography, dance and musical notation,
      more games, traditional desktop apps, web apps, mobile apps, VR,
      AR, brain-computer interfaces, <em>etc</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      What are the the most interesting and unusual interfaces?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Distill principles and look for commonalities systematically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start to ask: what kind of problems will lead to powerful new UI
      primitives?  What new UI primitives can we invent?  What are
      good sources of UI primitives outside of computing?
