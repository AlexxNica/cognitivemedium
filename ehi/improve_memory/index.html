    <p>
      Let me show you a flashcard program
      called <a href="http://ankirs.net">Anki</a>.  Here's one of my
      flashcards, asking how much solar radiation is received at the
      surface of the Earth:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/Anki_initial_card.png"/>

    <p>
      When shown a card, you pause to consider whether or not you know
      the answer.  Then you ask Anki to reveal the correct answer, so
      you can compare with your own response:
    </p>

    <img src="assets/Anki_initial_answer.png"/>

    <p>
      If you look at the bottom of the card you'll see buttons marked
      &ldquo;Again&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hard&rdquo;, and so on.  These
      buttons allow you to grade your response.  If you got the
      question wrong you tell the program you want to see the card
      &ldquo;Again&rdquo;.  If you got the question right, but
      struggled, you select &ldquo;Hard&rdqu;.  If you got the
      question right with relative ease, you select
      &ldquo;Good&rdquo;.  Finally, if you found the question
      trivially easy, you select &ldquo;Easy&rdquo;.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Which option you select determines how long before you see the
      card again.  If you selected &ldquo;Again&rdquo;, the card goes
      back in the queue of current cards, i.e., cards to be shown as
      soon as possible.  But if you selected any of the other three
      options, Anki will delay some time before showing you the card
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      How are the delays chosen?
    </p>

    <p>
      In an ideal world, Anki would try to show you a card just as you
      are on the verge of forgetting it.  There is a body of research
      suggesting that being tested on a memory at that point is the
      optimal time at which to be reminded of the content.  In
      particular, that's the time at which the memory will be most
      strengthened by a reminder.  And so you can minimize your total
      study time by studying at those times.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, Anki doesn't know exactly when is the right time to
      show a card again.  So it uses some heuristics.  The initial
      delay is 1 day.  If you select &ldquo;Good&rdquo; when you
      answer, then that will be increased by a factor 2.5, to 2.5
      days.  If you select &ldquo;Good&rdquo; again, it'll increase by
      another factor 2.5, to 6.25 days.  And so on, through
      ever-increasing delays.  If you select &ldquo;Hard&rdquo;, it
      tells Anki that the card is a difficult one for you, and so the
      factor 2.5 &ndash; known as the card's &ldquo;Ease&rdquo;
      &ndash; is too large, and is adjusted to be smaller.  On the
      other hand, if you select &ldquo;Easy&rdquo;, the card's ease
      will be adjusted upward, and the delay between repetitions will
      get even longer.  And finally, if you select
      &ldquo;Again&rdquo;, the delay gets reset to the initial value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anki is an example of a memory aid.  In this essay, I will
      review some of the cognitive science behind memory aids.  I will
      review how these ideas may be incorporated into the design of a
      wide range of software systems.  Not just flashcard programs,
      but in fact a wide range of software can incorporate these
      ideas.  I will also describe how current practices in many cases
      not only fails to take advantage of these ideas, but actually
      actively violates the ideas.  And I will sketch out several
      ideas for integrating the ideas into software systems (and
      everyday life) more generally.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Distributed practice</h2>
    
    <p>
      Anki is based around three ideas from cognitive science: the
      spacing effect, the lag effect, and the testing effect.  I'll
      now briefly describe each of these.  Each is actually quite
      complicated, and not entirely understood, so this is a
      caricature, to get our bearings.  I'll have more to say about
      details later.
    </p>

    <P>
      One of these ideas is called the <em>spacing effect</em>.
      Suppose you're have 100 flashcards which you're using to study
      100 words of Russian vocabulary.  In one approach to studying,
      you review each card once today, taking you 10 minutes, and you
      review each card again tomorrow, again taking you 10 minutes.
      Another approach to studying is to review all the cards twice
      each tomorrow, taking you 20 minutes.  The spacing effect
      predicts that if you're tested in a week, you'll do much better
      with the first approach: it's better to <em>space out</em> your
      study, rather than to use <em>massed presentation</em> (i.e.,
      cramming).  What's more, the effect is not small: even simple
      spacing strategies can double or more the speed at which you
      learn.
    </P>

    <p>
      How should we space out our study?
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1885, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus published
      experiments*<span class="marginnote">* Published in a translated
      English text
      as <a href="https://archive.org/details/memoryacontribu00ebbigoog">Memory:
      a Contribution to Experimental Psychology</a> (Teachers College,
      Columbia University, 1913).</span> from which he empirically
      deduced a <em>forgetting curve</em>.  The idea is that after
      learning a new fact, an unused memory will decay exponentially.
      In particular, the probability of later recall in a study
      session will look like this:
    </p>

    <center>
      <canvas id="forgetting" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
      <script>
      </script>
    </center>

    <p>
      In an equation, the probability of later recall is given by
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>p</em> = 2<sup>-<em>t</em> / <em>h</em></sup>,
    </p>

    <p>
      where <em>p</em> is the probability of recall, <em>t</em> is the
      time since the fact was last studied, and <em>h</em> is the
      <em>half-life</em> of the memory, that is, the time at which the
      probability.  The longer the half-life, the more strongly the
      memory is stored.  Ideally, the half-life is <em>&infty;</em>,
      that is, you'd never forget the fact, no matter how long you
      wait.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ebbinghaus exponential decay model assumes that you don't do
      anything to strengthen the memory before you're tested again.
      What happens if you are repeatedly tested, as in as flashcard
      program like Anki?  In that case, according to Ebbinghaus's
      model you get repeated exponential decays:
    </p>

    <center>
      <canvas id="forgetting_repeated" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
      <script>
      </script>
    </center>

    <p>
      However, there's an important twist.  The twist is that the
      memory half-life gets longer and longer.  Put differently, the
      memory gets stored better and better, and so we can wait longer
      and longer between practices.  This is why Anki keeps increasing
      the time between showing you a flashcard.  And, as we'll discuss
      shortly, this increase dramatically reduces the total amount of
      time required to memorize a fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gradual increase in half-life is known as the <em>lag
	effect</em>.  When combined with the spacing effect we'll call
	the idea <em>distributed practice</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anki is an example of a system for automating distributed
      practice.  Anki's increasing delays is very large.  On average,
      after more than a year of using Anki, I answer more than 94
      percent of flashcards correctly.  If that holds, it means that
      for a typical card I can expect about 16 study sessions before
      an error.  With the way Anki increases the delays, that will
      actually more than cover my lifetime.  In fact, about 11 study
      sessions should cover the remainder of my life.  On average,
      each study session takes about 8 seconds.  So that's a total of
      under 2 minutes total lifetime study, to commit a fact to
      memory. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, there are many caveats to this discussion.  But it's useful
      as a ballpark picture, to get an understanding of how
      distributed practice works.
    </p>

    <h2>Better ways of choosing the time to the next practice</h2>

    <p>
      I've described how Anki chooses the time to schedule the next
      practice.  Implicitly, we can think of that scheduling algorithm
      as a (very rough) theory of how long to delay until the next
    </p>

    <p>
      Is it possible to do better?
    </p>

    <p>
      The website <a href="https://duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> attempts
      to use machine learning to more accurately estimate the spacing
      between repetitions.  Duolingo is a popular site for learning
      new languages.  XXX - what Duolingo does.
    </p>

    <p>
      Duolingo has XXX users.  Suppose I sign up for the site, and
      starting learning Spanish.  Intuitively, it should be possible
      for Duolingo to estimate my performance on future quizzes by
      looking at the performance of other users whose profile of
      performance is similar to mine.  In this way, Duolingo can 
    </p>

    <p>
      A little more formally, Duolingo uses their existing data to
      build a model to estimate the half-life as a function of a
      student's past performance, and of the lexical complexity of the
      current.  They call this procedure <em>half-life
      regression</em>.  With that estimate, they can then estimate the
      optimal time to quizz me again in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      I won't get into the details of their model.  Indeed, the model
      is frankly rather arbitrary.
    </p>
    

    <p>
      <strong>The certainty effect:</strong> A big part of the benefit
      of distributed practice for me is something that I dub the
      certainty effect.  In the past if I was reading a paper or book,
      memory was often uncertain.  I'm now able to attain certainty
      for a large class of things: if I want to remember it, I can
      simply <em>choose</em> to do so, by entering it into Anki.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've tested this to some considerable extreme.  I memorized
      perhaps 60 percent the first XXX of a book on the Bash shell.
      Doing so was easy and relatively quick, though tedious.  The
      result
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Anki does not give operational fluency:</strong>
    </p>
    
    Testing effect.  It's just a model.

    Structure: Explain the testing effect. Show a screenshot.
    Duolingo has recently begun using dist. practice.  But whereas
    Anki has a very crude model, Duolingo tries to build a slightly
    more sophisticated model.  In particular, they build a model which
    is able to estimate the half-life, based on past student
    behaviour, and on lexical knowledge of the word.  Intuitively, if
    someone gets a word right, adjust half-life up; if someone gets a
    word wrong, adjust half-life down, to oprimize some objective.
    It's still a relatively crude model, but they get some
    improvement.  Much more detailed work could be done.

    

    
    
    <h3>Distributed practice</h3>


    <p>
      A curiosity of the spacing effect is that it's so
      underused. Ebbinghaus's work appeared in 1885, and immediately
      had a big impact.  William James described it as XXX.  A steady
      stream of followups were done, gradually growing into a flood.
      The first review appeared in XXX.  While we have no more than a
      very incomplete understanding of the basis for the effect (on
      which more below), it's fair to say that the effect is: (a)
      strong; (b) robust across materials; and (c)
    </p>

    <p>
      All of which makes it curious that it's so underused.  It's not
      used at scale in any educational system I'm aware of.  Indeed,
      many educational practices actually run
      directly <em>contrary</em> to the effect. Textbooks often bunch
      similar practice problems together, rather than spreading them
      out. Many educational systems are based around large, infrequent
      exams, rather than One of the most cited papers on the effect
      actually aims to understand why it's been so underused.
    </p>

    <p>
      The systems which do allow
      
    A curiosity is that it's been relatively little used. One of the
    most cited papers is actually to a discussion
    

    I said earlier that Anki will ideally show you a card just as you
    are about to forget the contents of that card.  This is badly
    broken when
    
    It's been studied a tremendous amount.  First review was in.
    Steady stream ever since.  More .  The picture is somewhat
    complex, a point I'll come back to. But the broad picture is 

    

    Why is this so little used?
    
    Curiosity: One strange thing about Sebasitan Leitner.  Piotr Wozniak.  One of the
    most-cited papers on the effect is about
    
    What we're going to do: We're going to poke around.  We're going
    to brainstorm

    First, though, I need to digress to talk a little about the role
    of cognitive science in all this.

    <p>
      <strong>Anti-patterns:</strong> It's not just that distributed
      practice isn't widely used in .  In fact a lot of conventional
      wisdom and widely used patterns of design <em>directly
      contradict</em> what we know about memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, many textbooks clump subject matter together.  A
      geography textbook may clump material into topical sections.
      Everything on South Africa (including quiz questions) into this
      section!  Everything on Madagascar into that section!  And so
      on.  So you spend a day on South Africa, a day on Madagascar,
      and so on.  It'd be better to have the material &ndash;
      especially the quiz questions &ndash; spread out.
    </p>

    <p>
      A friend of mine frequently complains about the length of books.
      &ldquo;Good book&rdquo;, he'll say, &ldquo;but it got
      repetitive.  The content could have been covered in a few
      pages&rdquo;.  This is undoubtedly true of many books.  But I
      wonder if the benefit of having it spread out over 300 pages
      isn't to ensure some distributed practice.
    </p>
      
    The effect is lesser
    
    The research

    <a name="cargo_cults_and_design"></a>
    <h2>The relationship between cognitive science and design</h2>

    <p>
      There's a genre of &ldquo;science&rdquo;-based books who use a
       form that I trust you will recognize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's say you're curious about meditation, and so you pick up a
      book on the subject.  The book claims to be based on scientific!
      studies! of meditation.  Every few pages the book drops in a
      handful of references to scientific papers.  It will claim
      &ldquo;studies show meditation improves your ability to
      focus&rdquo;, and cite 3 or 4 papers.  It's kind of dropping the
      authority of <strong>SCIENCE</strong> on your head, daring you
      to disagree.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conclusions of such an approach aren't always wrong.  But
      there's many problems with the approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      One problem is confirmation bias and motivated reasoning.  Maybe
      20 studies have been done to understand how meditation relates
      to focus.  The author quotes just 3 studies, which happens to be
      the 3 studies most sympathetic to the conclusion they want to
      support.
    </p>

    <p>
      This sounds like malice, but it's not. Powerful forces push all
      of us in this direction.  It's human nature to be more skeptical
      of papers whose conclusions disagree with what you believe; and
      to have like-minded friends and colleagues share and talk about
      papers whose conclusions you like.  And so an intelligent author
      can, without malice, end up with a very distorted view of what
      is known.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Other problems also arise.  Maybe all 20 studies are sympathetic
      to the author's conclusion.  But the reason for this may well be
      that the entire community doing the studying is too-sympathetic
      to one particular point of view.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, early in her career the writer and psychologist
      Susan Blackmore investigated parapsychology.  There's a
      surprisingly large and active community of people attempting
      scientific-appearing study of parapsychology, and finding
      positive results.  Blackmore*<span class="marginnote">* Susan
      Blackmore, <a href="assets/Blackmore1987.pdf">The Elusive Open
      Mind: Ten Years of Negative Research in Parapsychology</a>
      (1987).</span>  describes years of frustration at obtaining
      negative results, and the response of her peers:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Why did this study also fail? I had used trained subjects in
      psi-conducive conditions and a method others had found
      successful. The ultimate suggestion of most parapsychologists
      was that it was an experimenter effect—more than that, it was a
      psi-mediated experimenter effect. That is, either I was using my
      own negative psi or I had some kind of personality defect, or
      defect in belief, that suppressed the psi of other people. I was
      a psi-inhibitory experimenter, so that whatever I did I would
      always get negative results. I began to get the feeling that I
      had some creeping sickness. I was a failure, a reject; there was
      something in me that suppressed the true spiritual nature of
      other people. I tried not to let it upset me, but I must admit
      that there is something terribly unflattering about being
      labeled &ldquo;psi-inhibitory&rdquo;!
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Parapsychology is an extreme case, but it's not that extreme.
      In XXX, some of the most celebrated findings of psychology have
      come under attack.  Consider the phenomenon of priming.  
    </p>
      
    <p>
      A second set of problems involves the appalling norms around
      reporting in cognitive science.  Suppose a paper takes a group
      of 20 people, mounts an intervention, and (say) finds that
      certain test scores go up.  There's then a kind of shorthand way
      this is reported: &ldquo;such-and-such an intervention causes
      physics scores to go up!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, no.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what to learn from all this?  Well, there's many things.
      Here are a few of the most important for our purposes:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If you want to understand what a result says, and how
	strong the evidence is, you need to read the whole study in
	detail:</strong>  
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If you're looking for design inspiration, it's fine to
      </strong>
    </p>


    Style 1: The kind that thinks it should all be justified by
    cognitive science.  We hardly know anything about cognitive
    science.

    Our style: It will be to simultaneously keep in mind that we
    hardly k

    There's a kind of person who sneers at &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo;
    self-help books.  But, in fact, many of the
    &lsquo;scientific&rdquo; books are even worse, relying on a veneer
    of respectability provided by the fact that they are &ldquo;backed
    by scientific studies&rdquo;.

    The only resolution I know of to these problems is to get in
    fairly deeply to the details.  What was actually done?
    
    In the case of the spacing effect, a very large number of papers
    have been written, studying many different variations of the
    spacing effect.  The great majority show very strong .  


      So I think the right rules are this:

      + We're going to put imaginative design first.

      + Use papers for inspiration.

      + If you don't read for detail, you really don't know much.

    What's the right schedule?  If it's 90+ percent, doesn't that
    suggest that we're being too conservative?  Why not auto-adjust?

    How useful is it all?  How useful is it to know the solar constant?

    I wonder if we can do a reverse NMR thing, basically writing
    thoughts?
